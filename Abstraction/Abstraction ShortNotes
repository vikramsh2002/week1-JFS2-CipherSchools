$ Abstraction
  -----> It refers to the ways of data hiding or not showing the irrevelant info to the person
  Eg: A website has 3 sextions 
  		1. Guest            : Only Gallery
  		2. Registerd User   : Can See their own Profile only 
  		3. Admin  			: Can see all the info includings the codes
  		
 ------>This split of information can be achived via abstraction
 ------>In java there are two ways of abstraction
 	
 	
 	1. Via the abstract class :  It provide partial abstraction  since an abstract may or may not have 
 	abstract func.
 			
 	
 	2. Via the interface :  It provides 100% abstraction since every function is by deafult abstract
